# Description: Replay buffer for DQN agent to store transitions and sample mini-batches for training.

class ReplayBuffer:
    """
    A Replay Buffer for storing and sampling transitions, typically used in reinforcement learning.

    The ReplayBuffer stores transitions up to a specified capacity. It allows adding new transitions
    and sampling a random batch of transitions for training purposes.

    Attributes:
        buffer (deque): The internal buffer storing the transitions.

    Methods:
        push(transition):
            Adds a transition to the buffer.
        
        sample(batch_size):
            Samples a random batch of transitions from the buffer.
        
        __len__():
            Returns the current number of transitions stored in the buffer.
    """

    def __init__(self, capacity):
        """
        Initializes the ReplayBuffer with a given capacity.

        Args:
            capacity (int): The maximum number of transitions the buffer can hold.

        Adds a transition to the buffer. If the buffer is full, the oldest transition is removed.
