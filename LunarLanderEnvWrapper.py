class LunarLanderEnvWrapper(gym.Env):
    """
    A custom wrapper for the Lunar Lander environment from Gymnasium.

    This wrapper allows for custom gravity settings and optional wind conditions 
    to be applied to the Lunar Lander environment. It provides methods to reset 
    the environment, perform actions, render the environment, and close it.

    Attributes:
        env (gym.Env): The base Lunar Lander environment from Gymnasium.
        state (numpy.ndarray): The current state of the environment.
        gravity (tuple): The gravity setting for the environment, applied as (x, y) vector.
        action_space (gym.spaces.Space): The action space of the environment.
        observation_space (gym.spaces.Space): The observation space of the environment.

    Methods:
        reset():
            Resets the environment to its initial state and returns the initial observation.
        step(action):
            Takes an action in the environment and returns the next state, reward, 
            done flag, truncated flag, and additional info.
        render(mode='human'):
            Renders the environment.
        close():
            Closes the environment and releases any resources.
    
    Example:
        env = LunarLanderEnvWrapper(gravity=(0, -9.8), enable_wind=True, wind_power=10.0)
        state, info = env.reset()
        next_state, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
