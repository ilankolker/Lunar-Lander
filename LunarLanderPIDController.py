class LunarLanderPIDController:
    """
    A controller for the Lunar Lander environment using PID controllers for vertical, horizontal, 
    and angular control.

    This class implements a PID-based control strategy for navigating the Lunar Lander. It uses 
    three separate PID controllers to manage the vertical velocity, horizontal velocity, and angle 
    of the lander. Based on the output of these controllers, the appropriate action is selected 
    to control the lander.

    Attributes:
        env (gym.Env): The Lunar Lander environment instance.
        vertical_pid (PIDController): PID controller for vertical velocity.
        horizontal_pid (PIDController): PID controller for horizontal velocity.
        angle_pid (PIDController): PID controller for angular position.

    Methods:
        select_action(state):
            Determines the appropriate action based on the current state using the PID controllers.
        run():
            Runs multiple episodes of the environment with the PID controller and tracks performance.
    
    Example:
        env = LunarLanderEnvFuel()
        controller = LunarLanderPIDController(env)
        controller.run()
    """
