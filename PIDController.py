class PIDController:
    """
    A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.

    This class implements a basic PID controller that calculates an output value
    based on a setpoint and a measurement. The controller aims to minimize the error
    between the setpoint and the measurement by adjusting the output.

    Attributes:
        Kp (float): Proportional gain.
        Ki (float): Integral gain.
        Kd (float): Derivative gain.
        setpoint (float): The desired setpoint that the controller aims to reach.
        integral (float): The accumulated integral of the error over time.
        previous_error (float): The error from the previous step, used to calculate the derivative term.

    Methods:
        compute(measurement, dt):
            Computes the control output based on the current measurement and time step.
